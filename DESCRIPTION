Description: STAN (STrand-specic ANnotation of genomic data) implements
        bidirectional Hidden Markov Models (bdHMM), which are designed
        for studying directed genomic processes, such as gene
        transcription, DNA replication, recombination or DNA repair by
        integrating genomic data. bdHMMs model a sequence of successive
        observations (e.g. ChIP or RNA measurements along the genome)
        by a discrete number of 'directed genomic states', which e.g.
        reflect distinct genome-associated complexes. Unlike standard
        HMM approaches, bdHMMs allow the integration of strand-specific
        (e.g. RNA) and non strand-specific data (e.g. ChIP).
